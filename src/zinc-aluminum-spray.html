          <strong>Air Conditioning Plant:</strong>
          In this operation, the blower, fan blower, etc. may be zinc sprayed over the rotor
          casting, inlet cone, and base frame to prevent rusting and ensure long life.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Refrigeration, Chilling and Cold Storage Plant:</strong>
          Initially, the above-mentioned plantâ€™s equipment â€” pipe coil, U-tactic coil, and fan tube
          coil â€” should be thoroughly cleaned by sand blasting to achieve
          <strong>SA 2 1/2</strong>
          quality grade. After that, Zinc Spray may be applied.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Ice Cream and Ice Cream Plant:</strong>
          The pipe coil erected on the platform helps achieve a very low temperature to maintain the
          quality of liquids such as water, milk, ice cream, cheese, butter, buttermilk, and other
          related products.

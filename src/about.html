      <strong>The Creative Business System</strong>
      was established by
      <strong>Mr. Dhiren Desai</strong>
      in 1994. He is a
      <strong>NACE (National Association of Corrosion Engineering)</strong>
      degree holder. He started with trading of coating materials and anti-corrosive applications.
      While doing this, he came across many environmental conditions at various projects, which
      produce acid fumes, alkalis, solvent fumes and various types of gases in different
      temperatures. He found that while giving the proper system of coating to a particular customer
      site, it is not only important what is the condition at the site, but also what are the
      conditions at nearby plants, where a proper coating system should be applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to him, to remain and progress in any business, a company has to take care of two
      assets. The first asset is the company itself, for which they are working. The second asset is
      <strong>Creative Business System’s</strong>
      own asset — its employees. The company takes care of employee progress by providing training
      through professionals. The training includes marketing personnel and technical applicators,
      who receive continuous updates through small courses that align them with current market
      conditions. The company invests in employee training, which helps
      <strong>Creative Business Systems</strong>
      deliver quality products to customers on time and complete jobs as scheduled.
    </p>
    <p>
      By giving proper coating systems for your assets,
      <strong>Creative Business Systems</strong>
      increases the life of your structures three to four times. This means saving money that would
      otherwise be spent rebuilding the structure. The proper coating system reduces plant
      shutdowns, directly lowering production costs — another way to save money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Desai used to study environmental conditions at and around the site. He found that special
      coating materials were needed to protect the assets of a particular company. Considering these
      requirements, he started manufacturing special coating materials and thus progressed from a
      trader to a manufacturer. He started manufacturing in
      <strong>1998</strong>
      .

      Mr. Vinod Shah, he passed out Bachelor of Science from S. P. University (Vallabh Vidhyanagar)
      and Corrosion Tech from M.S. University, Baroda. Since 1986, he has been dealing with
      corrosion, chemical analysis, and polluted atmospheric effects. He is an expert in
      understanding how corrosion results from different types of chemical reactions in factories
      and in providing effective solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rajendrakumar Mishra, Manager Technical, has been working with us since 1998 and is deeply
      involved in developing various products to combat critical corrosive environments in different
      projects. He completed his Bachelor of Science in 1986 and Paint Technologist Examination in
      1988. He has worked on major projects including Reliance–Jamnagar, Godrej, Mahindra &amp;
      Mahindra, PSL, Suzlon, L &amp; T, Essar, and Metro Railway–Delhi during 1986–1998. Since
      joining us, he has contributed as Manager Technical and delivered lectures at GPA (Gujarat
      Paint Association) and ISSPA (Indian Small Scale Paint Association) in Delhi and Rajasthan on
      product development and testing.

        It is extremely important to understand not only which coating materials are selected, but
        also how they are applied to the surface. Even the best coating will fail to protect if it
        is not applied correctly. At Creative Business Systems, we ensure every coating application
        is carried out with precision and care. Since 1994, we have been working with a team of over
        60 highly trained applicators who possess extensive field experience. For large-scale
        industrial projects, our operational capacity allows us to deploy up to 180 skilled
        applicators to ensure quality and timely completion.

          Our paint manufacturing facility and application activities are supported by a
          state-of-the-art R&amp;D laboratory, application workshop, and online testing systems. The
          R&amp;D lab is equipped with advanced apparatus and pilot production equipment such as
          acid and alkaline corrosion testing chambers, solvent testing chambers, DFT calibration
          meters, viscosity devices, surface profile gauges, portable spray booths, ovens, and
          instruments for testing raw materials and final product quality.

        <p>
          Becoming an expert in coating application and manufacturing does not happen overnight; it
          takes years of R&amp;D and application excellence to produce systems effective in today’s
          global market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responding to industry needs for corrosion control and food-compatible coatings, we
          developed a solvent-free coating with all required features. This led to PROMASTIC–555, a
          unique refractory coating effective against acids, alkalines, solvents, and gaseous
          corrosion. We thank our scientists, technicians, and employees for their contribution to
          this success.

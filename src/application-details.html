    <h4>Present Indian Scenario</h4>
    <p>
      India loses around Rs. 24000 crores every year on account of corrosion and enormous number of
      infrastructures along with cost of Indian economy, which are corroding in crying need of
      repairing and rehabilitation. Rebuilding them we would mean it in decreased expenditure. We
      need to fight against corrosion using corrosion protection techniques; the latest techniques
      are now available in our country.
    </p>

    <p>
      Metals are mostly in the form of their oxides, sulfates, chlorides, silicates, basic
      carbonates etc... Almost every metal surface comes in contact with gases or liquids and the
      decay of metal is either due to chemical or electrochemical reactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any chemical process or electrochemical reaction, which starts decay or destruction of the
      metal due to surrounding environment is called corrosion. The most popular type of corrosion
      is rusting (Iron & steel). When metal comes in contact with atmospheric air or solid-gas
      halogenous system and under this condition, corrosion starts, which is termed as an
      Atmospheric Corrosion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost all machinery and other resources are partly made of steel if not fully. In order to
      increase industrial advancement, it is necessary to make sure that the steel is made corrosion
      resistant by using the right kind of protective coating.
    </p>
   
      <p><strong>We specialize in the following services:</strong></p>
      <ul class="service-list">
        <li>Inspection and detection of corrosion in assets and resources on site.</li>
        <li>
          Recommendations for implementing corrosion prevention systems, including methods of
          cleaning the surface and the degree of cleaning required.
        </li>
        <li>
          Periodic checks of the anti-corrosive paint work to ensure that the protective systems are
          in place.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Protex brand of protective coating has been continuously evolving over the years to meet
        the changing requirements of anti-corrosive coating. We are wholly committed towards
        complete customer satisfaction through high quality and consistent supply. We believe in not
        only delivering the products but also in transferring our technology at best rates and user
        friendly application.
      </p>

      <p>
        We would love to have you on board of our large family of customers. We intend create a
        disruptive effect
      </p>

      <h4>How Corrosion Destroys</h4>

      <p>
        Corrosion may begin in a small way, but gradually increases in manifold as corrosion occupy
        20 to 30 times the volume occupied by the original matter. Speed of expansion takes place,
        cracks soon appears and this further aggravates corrosion, leads to total working capacity
        of structure. At this stage, nothing much can be done to prevent the laiture of the
        structures. You have to either rehabilitate or rebuild.
      </p>

      <p>
        To find a permanent solution to the problem of corrosion, several methods have been tried;
        however none of them have been so successful in preventing corrosion in the long term basis.
        Some methods have even aggravated the problem to some extent, but the only solution is to
        apply a suitable protective coating.
      </p>

      <h4>Proper Material Selection</h4>

      <p>
        Your project may result into failure if you have not applied the exact system of material
        selection. The wrong material selection at the time of project preparation confirms the
        corrosion.
      </p>

      <p>
        For old rusted surface, we can provide specialized surface preparation system before
        applying anti-corrosive coating application.
      </p>

      <p>Now, you will be benefited from coatings, which are as follows.</p>

        <li>Time saver.</li>
        <li>Richest economy.</li>
        <li>Special attractive surface.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Through our consultant’s guideline, R and D work, laboratory testing and experience, we can
        provide all acid, alkaline, solvent resistant systems. We also provide resistant systems for
        chemical fumes, gases, temperature and sea water effect in direct approach.
      </p>

      <h4>Mechanical Cleaning:</h4>

      <p>
        The oil and grease have to be removed first by wiping with solvents such as mineral
        turpentine, petrol, petroleum solvent, trichloroethylene, tri sodium phosphate or by
        detergent degreasing. The secondary layers of scales and rust removed by hand tools and then
        remaining rust and scale removed by the use of sanding machines, scales, needle guns or
        rotary disk colorants.

      <p>
        Blast cleaning is a process by which the surface is being prepared by bombardment with small
        hard particles directed at the surface at very high velocity resulting into the de-scaling
        of all scale and rust. To some extent, even the steel surface itself is ruptured. ​
